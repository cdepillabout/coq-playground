(** Defining a few variable names as notational shorthands will make
    examples easier to read: *)

Definition W : string := "W".
Definition X : string := "X".
Definition Y : string := "Y".
Definition Z : string := "Z".

(** (This convention for naming program variables ([X], [Y],
    [Z]) clashes a bit with our earlier use of uppercase letters for
    types.  Since we're not using polymorphism heavily in the chapters
    developed to Imp, this overloading should not cause confusion.) *)

(** The definition of [bexp]s is unchanged (except that it now refers
    to the new [aexp]s): *)

Inductive bexp : Type :=
  | BTrue
  | BFalse
  | BEq (a1 a2 : aexp)
  | BLe (a1 a2 : aexp)
  | BNot (b : bexp)
  | BAnd (b1 b2 : bexp).

(** ** Notations *)

(** To make Imp programs easier to read and write, we introduce some
    notations and implicit coercions.  You do not need to understand
    exactly what these declarations do.  Briefly, though:
       - The [Coercion] declaration stipulates that a function (or
         constructor) can be implicitly used by the type system to
         coerce a value of the input type to a value of the output
         type.  For instance, the coercion declaration for [AId]
         allows us to use plain strings when an [aexp] is expected;
         the string will implicitly be wrapped with [AId].
       - [Declare Custom Entry com] tells Coq to create a new
         "custom grammar" for parsing Imp expressions and
         programs. The first notation declaration after this tells Coq
         that anything between [<{] and [}>] should be parsed using
         the Imp grammar. Again, it is not necessary to understand the
         details, but it is important to recognize that we are
         defining _new_ interpretations for some familiar operators
         like [+], [-], [*], [=], [<=], etc., when they occur between
         [<{] and [}>]. *)
