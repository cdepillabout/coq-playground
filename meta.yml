  ## Documentation

  ### Building

  If you're using Nix, you can get into a shell with Coq available by running
  `nix develop`:

  ```console
  $ nix develop
  ```

  You can build all the Coq files in this repo with `make`:

  ```console
  $ make
  ```

  After building, you can open up any of the files in
  [`theories/`](./theories/) in `coqide` in order to work through the proofs.

  You can regenerate the files in this repo (like `README.md`) from the
  [`meta.yml`](./meta.yml) file by cloning
  [`coq-community/templates`](https://github.com/coq-community/templates) and
  running `generate.sh`:

  ```console
  $ /some/path/to/coq-community/templates/generate.sh
  ```

  You can also generate HTML documentation with `coqdoc`:

  ```console
  $ make html
  ```
